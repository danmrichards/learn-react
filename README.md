# Learn React

React training based on https://laracasts.com/series/do-you-react

## Notes

Lesson 3 onwards requires a server; quickest way to do this is to just run a local PHP server:

```
php -S localhost:8885
```

And then go to [http://localhost:8885/LESSON_FILE.html](http://localhost:8885/LESSON_FILE.html) in the browser, where LESSON_FILE is the html file you want to view.
